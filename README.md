# On-Premise Active Directory Installation (Client-Server)

## Description

This repository provides guidance and resources for setting up an on-premise Active Directory (AD) installation in a client-server environment. Active Directory is a Microsoft technology that provides directory services, authentication, and access control for network resources in a Windows environment. By installing AD on-premise, organizations can centralize user management, simplify authentication, and enforce security policies across their network infrastructure.

### Features

- **Domain Controller Setup**: Configure one or more servers as domain controllers to manage directory services.
- **User and Group Management**: Create and manage user accounts, groups, and organizational units (OUs) within the AD domain.
- **Group Policy Configuration**: Define and enforce security policies, user settings, and system configurations using Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
- **DNS Integration**: Integrate Domain Name System (DNS) services with AD for name resolution and service location.
- **Replication and Fault Tolerance**: Implement replication mechanisms to ensure high availability and fault tolerance of AD services.
- **LDAP Integration**: Enable Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) access to directory services for application integration and directory querying.

### Prerequisites

To set up an on-premise Active Directory installation, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Windows Server**: Install Windows Server operating system on the designated server machines.
- **Server Hardware**: Ensure sufficient hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage) to support domain controller roles and services.
- **Network Configuration**: Configure network settings, including IP addressing, subnetting, and DNS resolution.
- **Administrative Access**: Administrative privileges on server machines for installing and configuring AD roles and services.
